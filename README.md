# roaring-haskell

this is based off the leonine package. thanks to thsutton for providing code for me to work with/understand! 

do note that this is a learning project for haskell and its aim is NOT to implement the most optimised version of roaring-bitmaps but rather, to learn haskell by implementing roaring-bitmaps.

all contributions are welcome.
